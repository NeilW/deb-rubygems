Description: libraries to use RubyGems, a package management framework
 This is a way to package Ruby libraries/applications for distribution.
 RubyGems provides the ability to manage concurrent versions of libraries and
 dependencies between those libraries. Using RubyGems, you can:
   * download and install Ruby libraries easily
   * not worry about libraries A and B depending on different versions of
     library C
   * easily remove libraries you no longer use
 .
 This package contains RubyGems' libraries. The commands are included in
 `rubygems' package.
