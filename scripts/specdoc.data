h3. Introduction

In order to create a gem, you need to define a gem specification, commonly
called a "gemspec".

A gemspec consists of several _attributes_.  Some of these are required;
most of them are optional.  The main body of this document is an alphabetical
list of gemspec attributes, each with a description, example usage, notes, and
more.
